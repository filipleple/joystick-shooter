# joystick_shooter
Simple shooter game in SDL2, supporting a custom made USB controller with termios library.

The controller is an arduino with a joystick module.

Player is controlled by the joystick (alt. arrow keys), going up or down to duck incoming walls and enemies.
Enemies can also be shot by pressing X.

This is a work in progress - namely main and pause menus are missing, bugs are very much possible.

Plan on adding sprites and sounds in the future.
